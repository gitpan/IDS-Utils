IDS Algorithm and Data Source modules for testing IDS algorithms.

Copyright 2005-2007 Kenneth Ingham.  All rights reserved.

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the same terms as Perl itself.

No special prerequisites *UNLESS* you are going to be debugging DFAs.
Then you need PerlTk.  If you are a tester or good perl coder, I would
love to get suggestions about how to make this independent of the DFA
code, since it has to dig deeply into the DFA code to allow the
debugging.

This software was research software that I used as a part of my PhD
research.  You can get my dissertation at 
http://www.i-pi.com/~ingham/dissertation-twoside.pdf

Parts of this software were described in the following journal
articles/conference presentations:

@article{ingham2007jocn,
    author = "Kenneth L. Ingham and Anil Somayaji and John Burge and
              Stephanie Forrest",
    title = "Learning {DFA} Representations of {HTTP} for Protecting Web
             Applications",
    month = "11 April",
    year = 2007,
    journal = "Computer Networks",
    volume = 51,
    number = 5,
    pages = "1239--1255 ",
    doi = "http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2006.09.016",
}


Expected changes/enhancements:

I do not intend on enhancing this software further, but it all depends
on how post-PhD research goes.  I solicit bug reports and enhancements.
This note will change (and the version number of the package will also
change) if this state of affairs changes.

Revision history:

Version 1.0: First public release.
